      <p><em>Dear Sir,</em></p>
      <p>
        We did what we thought was right. I tried to serve with devotion, but in
        the end, we failed you. The guilt of it still weighs on me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I could change what happened, but it’s too late now. I hope
        you’ve found peace, even if I never will.
      </p>
      <p><em>Honestly,</em></p>

        Mr. Rogers is a man who tries to maintain control, but like his wife, he
        is burdened by guilt. He’s a servant on the island, but his past
        involvement in a death continues to haunt him. While he tries to stay
        calm, his fear of being found out grows. Mr. Rogers is a tragic figure
        who wants to live a peaceful life but can’t escape the consequences of
        his past. His guilt and anxiety make him a more complex character.
