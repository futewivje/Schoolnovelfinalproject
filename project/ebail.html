      <p><em>Dear Beatrice,</em></p>
      <p>
        I did what I believed was right, casting you out for your sin. I told
        myself it was God’s will, but your cries still echo in my mind. I pray
        for forgiveness, though I know it may never come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your death weighs heavily on me, yet I cannot admit fault. Perhaps this
        is my penance—to live with the memory of what I have done.
      </p>
      <p><em>Sincerely, Emily Brent</em></p>

        Emily Brent is a cold, self-righteous woman who follows her strict
        beliefs with no room for forgiveness. She sees herself as morally
        superior, yet the guilt from casting out Beatrice Taylor is always with
        her. She refuses to acknowledge her mistakes, hiding behind her rigid
        views. Emily’s belief that she is always right makes her an interesting
        character, as she becomes blind to her own faults. Her inability to
        admit to her wrongs creates a tension that defines her, making her both
        fascinating and frustrating. I personally don’t like this character.
