      <p><em>Dear Leslie,</em></p>
      <p>
        Not a day passes that I don’t think of you. I trusted you, loved you—and
        yet you betrayed me. The pain of your betrayal was unbearable, but what
        hurt even more was knowing you loved him.
      </p>
      <p>I hope you can forgive me, though I know I don’t deserve it.</p>
      <p><em>Yours always, General Macarthur</em></p>

          <strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Retired and increasingly detached from

          over his involvement in his wife’s death. He is resigned to his fate
          on the island.

        General Macarthur is a man weighed down by his past. He was once a
        respected soldier, but the betrayal involving his wife and her lover led
        him to do something unforgivable. His slow descent into madness on the
        island shows his inability to cope with his guilt. He seems to accept
        death as a form of punishment. Macarthur is a tragic character, one who
        cannot escape his past, and I find his inner conflict compelling. His
        story is about trying to escape the consequences of his actions, but
        ultimately, they catch up with him. I sympathize with him.
