      <p><em>Dear Miss Brady,</em></p>
      <p>
        Me and my husband tried our best to help you, truly we did. But maybe it
        wasn’t enough. I still wonder—could we have done more?
      </p>
      <p>
        The guilt lingers, though we never meant you harm. Wish you good in
        heaven.
      </p>
      <p><em>Sincerely, Mrs. Rogers</em></p>

        Ms. Rogers is a nervous woman who constantly worries about being caught
        for her past actions. She and her husband were responsible for their
        previous employer’s death, and that guilt weighs heavily on her. She
        tries to keep her composure, but fear always gets the better of her. Ms.
        Rogers is a tragic character because she is haunted by her mistakes, and
        the more she tries to hide from them, the more they consume her. Her
        constant anxiety makes her relatable, but also sad to watch. Don’t like
        this character, too much mendacity.
