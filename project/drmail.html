      <p><em>Dear Louisa,</em></p>
      <p>
        I never meant for things to end the way they did. I was tired,
        overworked—and careless. But no excuse can clear what happened that
        night. You trusted me with your life, and I failed you.

      <p><em>Regretfully,</em></p>

      <p>
        Dr. Armstrong is a man of reason and science, but his arrogance blinds
        him to his own mistakes. He caused a patient’s death, and that guilt
        never leaves him. He tries to ignore it, but as things unravel on the
        island, he becomes more paranoid and unsure of himself. Dr. Armstrong’s
        downfall is a result of his own pride and his inability to accept that
        he is not a perfect man. His character is tragic because he can’t come
        to terms with his mistakes, and that leads to his undoing.
