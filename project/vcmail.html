        I didn’t kill him, no. It wasn’t me. It was him, he drowned by himself,
        I was just away . . . for a bit. Yes, it was him. He walked to the sea
        and drowned himself ! I still need to go, my Hugo is waiting for me. He
        will marry me, certainly. I helped him that much, he can’t leave me
        alone, he can’t abandon me !
      </p>

        Vera Claythorne is definitely the smartest victim out of the 9. But, she
        met with a bad man, Hugo. She loves Hugo so much, she can even murder
        for him. But after Hugo gets the money from the boy that Vera murdered,
        he thinks that Vera killed someone, which is very unacceptable, so he
        kicked Vera away. But Vera still loves him. She is the last one to die
        among the 9 victims, and she ended her life by herself.
