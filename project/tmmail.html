      <p><em>Dear John and Lucy,</em></p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t my fault, just bad luck. You shouldn’t have been on the road.
        I didn’t mean to hurt anyone, but accidents happen. People need to be
        more careful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I won’t waste time feeling guilty. Life is meant to be lived fast and
        free. That’s how I’ve always done it, and I won’t apologize for it.
      </p>
      <p><em>Cheers,</em></p>

        Tony Marston is a carefree, reckless young man who seems to live for the
        thrill of life. He doesn’t think much about the consequences of his
        actions, and that leads to the death of two children in a car accident.
        He doesn’t feel guilt about it, as he doesn’t take life too seriously.
        Tony is the kind of person who thinks everything will always go his way,
        until it doesn’t. His character is frustrating because he has so much
        privilege and freedom, yet he’s blind to the impact of his actions on
        others. I don’t like this character because he didn’t take
        responsibility or have any regret.
