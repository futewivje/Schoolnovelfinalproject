      <p><em>Dear the 9 Escapers,</em></p>
      <p>
        You all had killed someone before, but the punishment didn’t land on
        you. You know you killed someone, but pretend you didn’t. I will make
        you feel the same pain as the person you murdered, be more scared, more
        afraid, more despair! Law can’t bring justice, then I will be the law to
        judge all of you! Good luck to the upcoming interesting game. I’m very
        excited. We will meet soon.

      <h2>Journal Entry</h2>
      <p>
        Justice Wargrave is a fanatic about what he believes in. He was a
        retired judge who knew more about law and crime than anyone else, but he
        still planned the murder, which highlights his crazy obsession and
        perfectionism. He is also disappointed in the justice he relies on,
        which allows criminals to escape from the punishment. He had seen bad
        people become good, and he had also seen bad people fall into deeper
        darkness. As a judge, he cannot let criminals get away with it. If the
        law cannot be fair, then I’m the law. This is his motivation. As a
        reader, I like this character very much. He is the most unique character
        in the story. His crazy, extreme, perfect, and unscrupulous personality
        attracted me deeply. If he is used in the right place, the effect will
        not be better. He is a very smart person. We can see this from the way
        he kills people. He has to use poetry to kill people. He also pretends
        to be a victim and successfully gains the trust of the others in this
        game. His mind never changes, stays the same all the time. I personally
        think that he likes the feeling that he is the highest one, the greatest
        one, the one that can judge people. He also likes to see people playing,
        scaring, and running under his control in a perverted way. He is a truly
        insane person. He is also a victim, the victim of justice.
